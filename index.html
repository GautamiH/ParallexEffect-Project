            <p class="text">
                An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky.[1] Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.
                <br> <br>
                Adventure is a mental encouragement. It involves adventurous tasks that are wilfully chosen by an individual. Every person needs some break from the busy life. He/she looks around for the activities that can add some thrill to life.

            <p class="text">
                Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials, and mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes. Mountain biking can generally be broken down into distinct categories: cross country, trail, all mountain, enduro, downhill.
                <br> <br>
                The sport requires endurance, core and back strength, balance, bike handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high-incline climbs. In the case of freeride, downhill, and dirt jumping, aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps.

            </div>

            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is essentially a foot launched aero sport in which the Paraglider ‘Pilot’ uses a ‘Paraglider canopy’ to take off from a mountain slope or from a flat ground using a winch, glides through the air climbing at times to the cloud base using ‘Thermals’ eventually ‘landing’ on a flat ground.  Being both a recreational and competitive sport, Paragliding has gained immense popularity and growth in India in the last decade or so. Paragliding is perhaps the simplest and by far the most economical way to take to the skies, soar over the mountains and lakes like a bird without engines using only the wind movement to stay aloft to enjoy sunsets from a totally different perspective.
                <br> <br>
                Paragliding is one of the simplest forms of flight and easiest to get involved in. It’s a popular hobby for those who not only enjoy the skill and thrill of flight, but also enjoy the outdoors and the amazing overhead views obtainable.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>

            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
                <br> <br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
